# SENSE

SENSE is a Mental Health Tracker Web App started by Javier and Guillermo over a weekend at CalHacks 5.0. The idea is to use external information  -- such as the type of music, the user is listening to and it's sentiment to predict how the user is feeling. In the event that the user is not doing so well, this information can then later be relayed to a trusted contact so they can check up on the user. Imagine a world where everyone uses SENSE. A world where there exists no stigma towards mental health issues. A better world.

 The languages and tools we used to create this project include: Spotify's API, IBM's Watson, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Tachyons.io

## Getting Started

The project is very roughly laid out. We intend to release a fully fledged product sometime in the near future. For now, enjoy playing around with what we have.

### Prerequisites

You will need a working version of Python and the files included in this repo. Including the images and text files.
