[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first, Blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and gun toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
'96 strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sending kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well-done meat, then send 22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

[Hook]
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose next are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes

[Verse 2: Havoc]
We rep the QBC, nigga, rep yours, it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs, adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce, 20 years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world, and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind-control you, double-edge blow you
It'll be I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QB City Godfather Pt III, Gotti, Gambino and Ty Nitty
Scarface, rest in peace!
