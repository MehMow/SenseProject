My nights don't seem so endless
My days don't seem so bad
I'm walking on a cloud
And there's music in the air

I feel just like a live wire
I've been thrilled through and through
Since i first met you

The stars that shine at night
Seem so more clear and bright
The world seems fresh and sweet
My life seems more complete

Through the lonely years I find my dreams are coming true
Since I first met you

I pray to the lord above
To send me someone to love
And now i know my prayers weren't in despair
Cause i opened up my eyes and you were there

Now my heart's no longer empty
Those happy days are here
My face is full of gladness
My eyes shed no more tears

I found myself a new love
At last i found a true love
Honey, now that i have you
(Now that I have you)
